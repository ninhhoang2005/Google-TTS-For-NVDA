# Google TTS For NVDA

An NVDA screen reader synthesizer add-on that uses Google's WebAssembly (WASM) Text-to-Speech engine locally through a supported browser runtime (Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome) to provide high-quality, natural-sounding voices offline.

This project grew from a simple dream: making Google TTS usable as a practical, everyday NVDA synthesizer on Windows computers.

*This add-on is co-developed by [Nguyen Anh Duc](https://github.com/nguyenanhduc09), [Dao Duc Trung](https://github.com/daoductrung) and [Pham Hung Vuong](https://github.com/phamhungvuong302).*

## Current Status

This add-on is currently being actively maintained and developed by Nguyen Anh Duc, Dao Duc Trung and Pham Hung Vuong. While functional, there are still a few known issues we are working on:
* Voices may load slowly upon the first initialization.
* Pauses and speech segmentation might occasionally be incorrect.

We highly welcome and appreciate any feedback from the community to help us improve!

## Features

* **Comprehensive Voice Support**: Supports all languages and voices available in WasmTtsEngine. This includes Chrome OS packages (optimized for frequent use and high-speed screen reading) and Google Natural packages (designed for higher quality, standard text reading).
* **100% Offline Speech**: Speech is rendered locally via a supported headless browser runtime (Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome).
* **Low Latency**: Uses advanced text segmentation (smaller first clause) to ensure instant speech responses.
* **Volatile Audio Cache**: In-memory cache for short phrases (under 5000 characters) to optimize repeated announcements safely.
* **Voice Manager**: Check, download, or remove voice packages in batches using a multi-select checkbox interface.
* **Background Operations**: Non-blocking downloads and removals on background threads.
* **Accessible Shortcut**: Press **`NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+G`** to open the Voice Manager instantly.

---

## Requirements

* **NVDA**: Version 2024.1 or newer.
* **Browser runtime**: Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome must be present on the system. The add-on will search common paths or check your registry automatically. You can also specify a custom path using the `EDGE_PATH` or `CHROME_PATH` environment variable.

## Installation & First Run

1. Download the latest `.nvda-addon` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/nguyenanhduc09/Google-TTS-For-NVDA/releases) page.
2. Open the package (or use NVDA's Add-on Store -> Install from external source) and follow the prompts to install it.
3. Upon first selecting **Google TTS For NVDA** as your synthesizer, if no voice packages are installed, NVDA will notify you and automatically open the **Google TTS Voice Manager...** dialog so you can download at least one voice package to use.
4. Alternatively, you can also press **`NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+G`** or go to **NVDA Menu -> Tools -> Google TTS Voice Manager...** at any time to manage your voice packages.
5. Check the boxes next to the voice packages you want, and click **Download checked voice packages**.

## Configuration Settings

The synthesizer supports the standard NVDA Speech settings ring:
* **Voice**: Choose from your installed speaker/language voice packages.
* **Rate**: Speech rate (maps to the browser runtime's 0.35x - 2.0x speed).
* **Rate Boost**: Enable to double the computed speech rate for fast reading.
* **Pitch**: Speech pitch adjustment.
* **Volume**: Speech volume (maps to the browser runtime's 0.0 - 1.0 volume range).

## Build Instructions (For Advanced Users)

To package the add-on yourself:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/nguyenanhduc09/Google-TTS-For-NVDA.git` and navigate to the directory.
2. Make sure you have **Python** and **Node.js** installed on your system.
3. Run the automated build script:

```bat
build.bat
```

The build script reads the version from `googleTtsForNvda/manifest.ini`, builds all add-on locales non-interactively, checks Python and JavaScript syntax, verifies that no `.zvoice` voice packages are inside the source tree, removes generated `__pycache__` folders, and packages the add-on.

The verified `.nvda-addon` package will be created in the `dist/` directory, with a name like:

```text
dist/googleTtsForNvda-0.3.nvda-addon
```

If you only want to validate or update translation files without packaging the add-on, use `build_i18n.py` directly. Running `python build_i18n.py` opens the numbered translation menu. For automation, use `python build_i18n.py --check --all-languages` to check all locales or `python build_i18n.py --all-languages` to build generated translation files for all locales.

## Contributing

We strongly welcome contributions from other developers! If you have ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Translations are welcome too. If you use Poedit to edit a translation and save synchronized `.po` and `.mo` files, `build_i18n.py` can be used to validate the result. If you use another translation tool that edits `.po` without generating or synchronizing `.mo`, the i18n script can build the generated files for you. Running `python build_i18n.py` opens the numbered translation menu by default, with broad choices first: all add-on locales before individual locales, and default/all checks before individual check categories. See [`TRANSLATING.md`](TRANSLATING.md) for the add-on's translation layout, validation commands, and optional `languageSort.json` files that let Voice Manager display language names in a natural order for each locale without changing catalog data.
