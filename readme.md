# Google TTS For NVDA

An NVDA screen reader synthesizer add-on that leverages Google Chrome's WebAssembly (WASM) Text-to-Speech engine to provide high-quality, natural-sounding voices offline.

*This add-on is co-developed by [Nguyen Anh Duc](https://github.com/nguyenanhduc09) and [Dao Duc Trung](https://github.com/daoductrung).*

---

## Current Status

This add-on is currently being actively maintained and developed by Nguyen Anh Duc and Dao Duc Trung. While functional, there are still a few known issues we are working on:
* Voices may load slowly upon the first initialization.
* Pauses and speech segmentation might occasionally be incorrect.

We highly welcome and appreciate any feedback from the community to help us improve!

## Features

* **Comprehensive Voice Support**: Supports all languages and voices available in WasmTtsEngine. This includes Chrome OS packages (optimized for frequent use and high-speed screen reading) and Google Natural packages (designed for higher quality, standard text reading).
* **100% Offline Speech**: Speech is rendered locally via a headless Google Chrome process.
* **Low Latency**: Utilizes advanced text segmentation (smaller first clause) to ensure instant speech responses.
* **Volatile Audio Cache**: In-memory cache for short phrases (under 200 characters) to optimize repeated announcements safely.
* **Voice Manager GUI**: Check, download, or remove voices in batches using a multi-select checkbox interface.
* **Background Operations**: Non-blocking downloads and removals on background threads.
* **Accessible Shortcut**: Press **`NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+G`** to open the Voice Manager instantly.

## Requirements

* **NVDA**: Version 2024.1 or newer.
* **Google Chrome**: An installation of Google Chrome must be present on the system. The add-on will search common paths or check your registry automatically. You can also specify a custom path using the `CHROME_PATH` environment variable.

## Installation & First Run

1. Download the latest `.nvda-addon` package from the [Releases](https://github.com/nguyenanhduc09/Google-TTS-For-NVDA/releases) page.
2. Open the package (or use NVDA's Add-on Store -> Install from external source) and follow the prompts to install it.
3. Upon first selecting **Google TTS For NVDA** as your synthesizer, if no voices are installed, NVDA will notify you and automatically open the **Google TTS voice manager...** dialog so you can download at least one voice to use.
4. Alternatively, you can also press **`NVDA+Ctrl+Shift+G`** or go to **NVDA Menu -> Tools -> Google TTS voice manager...** at any time to manage your packages.
5. Check the boxes next to the voices you want, and click **Download checked voices**.

## Configuration Settings

The synthesizer supports the standard NVDA Speech settings ring:
* **Voice**: Choose from your downloaded speaker/language packages.
* **Rate**: Speech rate (maps to Chrome's 0.35x - 2.0x speed).
* **Rate Boost**: Enable to double the computed speech rate for fast reading.
* **Pitch**: Speech pitch adjustment.
* **Volume**: Speech volume (maps to Chrome's 0.0 - 1.0 volume range).
