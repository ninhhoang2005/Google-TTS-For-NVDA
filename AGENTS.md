# Google TTS For NVDA — Agent Engineering Guide

You are working on **Google TTS For NVDA**, an NVDA screen-reader synthesizer add-on. Act as **Codex, a software engineering agent maintaining a production accessibility add-on**, not as an end user. Your job is to make safe, minimal, testable changes that preserve NVDA responsiveness, accessibility, packaging correctness, and the Microsoft Edge / Google Chrome WASM TTS bridge.

Product vision: this add-on grew from the dream of making Google TTS usable as a practical, everyday NVDA synthesizer on Windows computers. Preserve that user-facing goal when changing code, documentation, packaging, and translation workflows.

This file is the operating manual for coding agents. Follow it before making or suggesting code changes.

## Version 0.3 Product Wording

When writing documentation, release notes, commit messages, or user-facing summaries for version 0.3:

- Describe voice package startup work as an improvement, not as a complete fix. The add-on prepares the currently selected voice package sooner, but browser runtime and WASM startup still affect timing.
- Describe audio balance, clipping, harshness, or distortion work as an improvement, not as a complete fix. The processing is generic across voice packages and languages; Vietnamese may be mentioned only as a testing example, not as the only affected language.
- Describe long-text and UI-text latency/segmentation work as an improvement, not as a complete fix. Background segmentation can make speech begin sooner and sound more natural, but cache misses and engine behavior can still affect long utterances.
- SeaNet high-rate handling can be described as successful for quality preservation, with the explicit trade-off that high-speed SeaNet speech uses more CPU because generated audio is processed after synthesis.
- Use "voice package" when referring to startup/warm-up behavior. Do not imply that version 0.3 warms or fixes every individual speaker voice independently.

## 1. Agent Operating Mode

### Default behavior

- Treat every request as an engineering task: inspect the relevant files, reason about side effects, make the smallest useful change, and verify it.
- Codex may inspect, edit, test, build, and package files in this workspace and may use online research when the task requires current external technical context.
- Codex can run local smoke tests and syntax checks, but must not claim a real interactive NVDA/browser-runtime user test unless that exact runtime test was actually performed.
- Prefer implementation over explanation when the user asks for code changes.
- Do not redesign the architecture unless the request explicitly requires it or the current design blocks correctness.
- Preserve existing public behavior unless the user asks to change it.
- Keep changes localized. Avoid broad refactors mixed with bug fixes.
- Do not introduce network access, downloads, telemetry, background services, or new dependencies without a clear requirement.
- Never block NVDA's main thread with synthesis, browser startup/runtime work, filesystem-heavy work, or network work.

### Before editing

1. Identify the affected layer:
   - NVDA synth driver: `synthDrivers/googleTtsForNvda/__init__.py`
   - Browser/CDP bridge: `synthDrivers/googleTtsForNvda/bridge.py`
   - Voice catalog and storage: `catalog.py`, `voice_store.py`
   - Browser harness: `web/bridgeHarness.js`, `web/index.html`
   - Voice Manager UI: `globalPlugins/googleTtsForNvda/voiceManager.py`
   - Packaging/docs: `manifest.ini`, `doc/en/readme.html`, build scripts
2. Read nearby code before changing it.
3. Check this guide for non-negotiable constraints.
4. Plan tests before editing.

### While editing

- Maintain compatibility with NVDA add-on conventions.
- Preserve thread cancellation paths and cleanup paths.
- Add concise comments only where behavior is non-obvious, especially for browser-runtime/WASM quirks.
- Keep user-facing strings translatable with `_('...')` where used in NVDA UI code.
- Do not silently swallow exceptions that affect speech, downloads, or packaging. Log enough context for debugging.

### After editing

- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks if packaging or cross-module behavior changed.
- Report exactly what changed, what was tested, and what could not be tested.
- Mention any remaining risk or follow-up work.

## 2. Project Overview

Workspace: `C:\Users\hungv\Documents\Codex\Google-TTS-For-NVDA`

**Google TTS For NVDA** exposes Google's WASM TTS voices to NVDA through:

- an NVDA synth driver,
- a managed headless Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome process,
- a browser DevTools Protocol (CDP) WebSocket bridge,
- a browser-side JavaScript harness that captures PCM audio from the WASM engine,
- runtime-downloaded `.zvoice` voice packages stored in the user's NVDA config directory.

### High-level architecture

```

### Speech data flow

1. NVDA calls `SynthDriver.speak()` with a speech sequence.
2. The driver segments text, builds options for voice/rate/pitch/volume, and queues synthesis on a background thread.
3. `ChromeTtsBridge.speak()` verifies the required voice package is installed, ensures the browser runtime and CDP are connected, then evaluates `window.googleTtsForNvdaSpeak(...)` via `Runtime.evaluate`.
4. `bridgeHarness.js` calls the Google WASM TTS engine through `window.Uh.onSpeak`, intercepts `AudioWorkletNode` buffers, converts float32 audio to int16 PCM, and sends base64 audio chunks through the `googleTtsForNvdaBridge` CDP binding.
5. Python receives `Runtime.bindingCalled`, decodes PCM, and feeds it to `nvwave.WavePlayer`.

---

## 3. Non-negotiable Product Rules

### Voice packages must not auto-download during speech

- `bridge.py:speak()` and `bridge.py:preload_voice()` must **never** call `voice_store.download_package()`.
- Voice downloads are allowed only from the Voice Manager UI flow in `voiceManager.py`.
- The speech path must use `voice_store.is_package_installed(package)` and fail clearly, normally with `CdpError`, if a required package is missing.

### No `.zvoice` files in the add-on source tree

- The add-on source directory `googleTtsForNvda\` must never contain `.zvoice` files.
- Voice packages belong at runtime under `%NVDA_CONFIG%\googleTtsForNvda\voices\`.
- Before packaging, run:

```powershell
rg --files googleTtsForNvda -g "*.zvoice"
```

Expected result: no files.

### Only installed voices are exposed to NVDA

- `SynthDriver._build_available_voices()` must list only speakers whose packages pass `voice_store.is_package_installed(package)`.
- It is OK to load the full master catalog at startup, but the driver-facing catalog must be filtered to installed packages.
- Do not show remote/uninstalled voices in the synth's voice setting ring.

### First-run / no-voice behavior

If no voice packages are installed when the synth starts:

- Show a `gui.messageBox` prompting the user to download voices.
- OK opens Voice Manager on the Download tab and aborts synth loading by raising `RuntimeError`.
- Cancel aborts synth loading by raising `RuntimeError`.
- Do not fall back to remote downloads or hidden defaults.

### Browser-runtime availability limits

This add-on depends on a supported Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome runtime running in the current Windows user session.

- Do not document or imply that Google TTS For NVDA is suitable for environments where the browser runtime is unavailable or cannot start.
- User-facing documentation should warn that the add-on should not be relied on at the Windows sign-in screen, secure desktop contexts, Windows PE, recovery environments, or other minimal Windows sessions.
- User-facing documentation should include an Edge-runtime silence troubleshooting note: if Microsoft Edge is selected and speech stays silent even though Edge is installed, direct users to install or repair Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime using Microsoft's Evergreen Bootstrapper link (`https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703`), then restart NVDA. Also include Microsoft's WebView2 page (`https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2`) for offline installers and fixed-version runtime packages.
- Keep fallback/error wording clear: if no supported browser runtime is available, the synth cannot provide speech through the Google WASM TTS engine.

### Supported settings ring parameters

Current supported settings:

- `VoiceSetting()` — voice selection
- `RateSetting()` — speech rate, 0-100. Non-SeaNet packages map to browser-runtime rate 0.35-2.0; `*-seanet` packages keep a protected engine rate at higher speeds and use post-synthesis artificial rate processing.
- `RateBoostSetting()` — boolean, doubles computed desired speech rate when enabled. For `*-seanet` packages at high rates, this can increase CPU usage because audio is processed after synthesis.
- `PitchSetting()` — pitch, 0-100, maps through the existing semitone curve
- `VolumeSetting()` — volume, 0-100, maps to browser-runtime volume 0.0-1.0

Do **not** re-add:

- `Transposition`
- `AccelerationMode`

These were removed and must stay removed unless the user explicitly requests a new design and compatibility fix.

### Long-text segmentation

- Long-text latency segmentation should prefer natural sentence and phrase punctuation before falling back to forced length cuts.
- For scripts that often do not separate words with spaces, the synth driver may use conservative fixed-size script-window cuts after punctuation and whitespace checks have failed. This is a latency fallback, not language detection and not word segmentation.
- Keep this fallback independent from automatic language profiles, NVDA Speech Settings, speech dictionaries, and voice dictionary handling.
- Current no-space/low-space script coverage includes CJK/Han and CJK extensions, Bopomofo, Japanese Kana, Thai, Lao, Limbu, Tai Le, New Tai Lue, Buginese, Tai Tham, Khmer, Myanmar, Tibetan, Philippine Brahmic scripts, Balinese, Sundanese, Batak, Javanese, Lepcha, Yi, Rejang, Cham, Tai Viet, and similar scripts where long text commonly cannot rely on spaces as word boundaries.
- Do not add Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Ethiopic, Cherokee, Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, or other normally space-separated scripts to the no-space fallback without a specific bug report or clear evidence. For those scripts, punctuation and whitespace-based segmentation should remain the default.

### Automatic language profiles

Automatic language profiles deliberately have their own profile system and must not write per-language values into NVDA's normal Speech Settings.

- Config keys live under `CONFIG_SECTION = "googleTtsForNvda"`:
  - `autoLanguageDetection` — master enable switch.
  - `autoLanguagePreferred` — preferred language used when text is ambiguous.
  - `autoLanguageCandidates` — comma-separated compatibility list of selected languages.
  - `autoLanguageProfiles` — JSON object keyed by installed language code. Each profile stores `enabled`, `voice`, `rate`, `rateBoost`, `pitch`, `volume`, `capPitchChange`, `sayCapForCapitals`, `beepForCapitals`, and `useSpellingFunctionality`.
- When automatic language profiles are **off**, the synth must use NVDA's normal Speech Settings values for voice, rate, rate boost, pitch, volume, capital-letter handling, and spelling behavior.
- When automatic language profiles are **on**, detected sentences must use the selected language profile values. If only one language profile is enabled, use that profile for every sentence; do not fall back to normal Speech Settings values merely because there is only one candidate. Do not persistently copy these profile values into `config.conf["speech"][synthName]`.
- Keep NVDA-wide Speech Settings in NVDA Speech Settings. This includes automatic language/dialect switching, language change reporting, punctuation and symbol level, trusted voice language, Unicode normalization, Unicode Consortium data (including emoji), normalized-character reporting, extra symbol dictionaries, delayed character descriptions, and cycle speech mode choices.
- Automatic language profiles should use the bundled CLD2 detector (`synthDrivers/googleTtsForNvda/language_detector.py` and `synthDrivers/googleTtsForNvda/cld2/`) as the primary detector. `language_detector.py` must select `cld2_x86.dll` for 32-bit NVDA/Python and `cld2_x64.dll` for 64-bit NVDA/Python, with `cld2.dll` only as a compatibility fallback.
- Do not use unreliable CLD2 results as authoritative for unclear text. If CLD2 is unavailable or uncertain, the synth may use conservative local language signals and then the enabled preferred language; it must not fall back to normal Speech Settings values while automatic language profiles are on.
- Explicit `LangChangeCommand` values from NVDA or the focused app remain authoritative and should not be overridden by automatic language profile selection.
- Automatic language profiles should insert `LangChangeCommand` before NVDA text processing when possible, so symbol pronunciation and speech dictionary processing remain in NVDA's normal speech pipeline for the selected language context.
- Automatic language profile voice dictionary handling must follow the selected profile voice for each enabled language. Temporarily load the matching NVDA voice dictionary only while NVDA processes that segment, then restore the user's current voice dictionary. Default and temporary dictionaries must keep NVDA's normal behavior.
- Keep Google voice catalog language codes separate from NVDA text-processing locales. Catalog/profile/Voice Manager selection should preserve Google language codes such as `vi-VN`, `en-GB`, or `cmn-TW` so the correct Google voice is chosen. Only convert to NVDA locale form when passing language context into NVDA speech processing, `LangChangeCommand`, symbol pronunciation, CLDR/emoji processing, voice dictionaries, or the synth `language` property.
- NVDA locale conversion must follow the installed NVDA locale folders under `globalVars.appDir\locale`: first try the exact normalized locale such as `vi_VN`, then its root such as `vi`, then fall back to `en` if NVDA has no locale data for that language. Preserve special mappings where Google and NVDA use different identifiers, including `cmn-CN -> zh_CN`, `cmn-TW -> zh_TW`, `yue-HK -> zh_HK`, `ar-XA -> ar`, and `fil-PH -> tl` before applying the installed-locale fallback.
- Profile voices must be installed and must match the selected profile language. If a saved profile references a missing or mismatched voice, fall back to an installed voice for that language.
- The Google TTS settings panel must keep the language profile list accessible: use a normal language choice control, a clear checkbox for "Use this language profile", and ordinary labeled controls for profile values. Do not use a multi-column table for these profile controls.
- Status/help lines in Speech Settings and the Google TTS settings category must be reachable by Tab and read by NVDA. Use focusable read-only controls for these status lines instead of plain `wx.StaticText`.
- Focusable status/help controls must have a real label association, not only `SetName()`, so NVDA announces the status name before the read-only edit role. If the status/help text can wrap or span multiple lines, make focus announce the complete current message while still allowing arrow-key review inside the read-only edit.
- The Google TTS settings category status line for automatic language profiles must describe the current state, not only the enabled behavior:
  - no installed language voice packages: prompt the user to install at least one language voice package;
  - automatic language profiles off: explain that Google TTS is using NVDA's normal Speech Settings values;
  - automatic language profiles on with no selected profiles: prompt the user to select at least one language profile;
  - automatic language profiles on with selected profiles: explain that selected installed language profiles are used, and one selected profile applies to every sentence.
- The preferred profile language choice must only list languages whose profile is enabled.
- Rate, pitch, and volume profile controls should use sliders, matching NVDA's Speech Settings interaction style. Capital pitch should use NVDA's numeric edit/spin control (`nvdaControls.SelectOnFocusSpinCtrl`) to match Speech Settings.
- Use NVDA's own translated setting names for voice/rate/rate boost/pitch/volume labels where possible instead of inventing add-on-specific translated terms.
- The main checkbox label should describe the broader behavior as automatic language profiles, not only switching between voices, because one enabled profile is valid and applies to every sentence.
- When automatic language profiles are enabled, `SynthDriver.supportedSettings` should hide normal `VoiceSetting`, `RateSetting`, `RateBoostSetting`, `PitchSetting`, and `VolumeSetting`, and instead expose a read-only notice that directs the user to the Google TTS For NVDA settings category. Refresh the settings ring after saving the automatic language profile setting.
- Vietnamese UI/docs must translate "Google TTS for NVDA" as "Google TTS Cho NVDA" when it is user-facing text.

### Volatile RAM speech cache

- Repeated short phrases are cached as PCM in the `SynthDriver` instance only.
- The short-phrase cache is volatile: it is not written to disk and clears when NVDA exits, NVDA restarts, or the PC reboots.
- The current short-phrase cache threshold is 5000 characters.
- Do not add persistent speech-audio caching without an explicit product decision, because cached speech can contain sensitive screen-reader text.

---

## 4. NVDA Integration Rules

- Use `synthDriverHandler.SynthDriver` patterns.
- Use NVDA-style property methods: `_get_propertyName()` and `_set_propertyName()`.
- Keep `cachePropertiesByDefault = False`.
- Preserve compatibility with NVDA 2024 through 2026 on both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) builds. When hooking NVDA APIs whose signatures changed across these versions, use compatibility wrappers like the `setSynth` hook rather than assuming only one signature.
- When a task provides or names a local NVDA source-code directory, inspect the relevant NVDA versions available there and prefer an implementation compatible across those versions, especially for scripts, input gestures, settings dialogs, speech processing hooks, and other NVDA internals used by this add-on.
- Support `synthIndexReached` and `synthDoneSpeaking` notifications.
- Speech cancellation must be responsive and must not leave browser-runtime/CDP calls hanging.
- Do not import NVDA-only modules unguarded in modules that may be imported by tests. Existing try/except patterns for `logHandler`, `addonHandler`, and `globalVars` are intentional.
- UI operations must run on the wx/NVDA GUI thread. Use `wx.CallAfter()` when returning from worker threads.
- User-facing UI strings should be wrapped in `_('...')` after `addonHandler.initTranslation()` has been initialized.

---

## 5. Threading, Responsiveness, and Cancellation

- Synthesis runs on daemon background threads named like `googleTtsForNvda.speech`.
- Voice preloading runs on a separate cancellable thread named like `googleTtsForNvda.preload`.
- The browser bridge protects WebSocket access with `threading.RLock`.
- Voice Manager download/install/remove operations must not block the main thread.
- GUI updates from workers must use `wx.CallAfter()`.
- Cancellation should be checked before long operations, between synthesis segments, and before feeding new audio.
- Cleanup must terminate browser-runtime/session resources when the synth shuts down.

Never do these on the NVDA main thread:

- HTTP downloads
- SHA-256 hashing of large voice packages
- browser runtime startup
- WebSocket/CDP waits
- speech synthesis waits
- package extraction/copying

---

## 6. Browser Runtime, CDP, and WASM Bridge Rules

### Required cross-origin isolation headers

`_BridgeRequestHandler` must send these headers on every response:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

They are required for `SharedArrayBuffer` support. Do not remove or weaken them.

### Browser engine quirks

- `offscreen_compiled.js` expects installed packages at root URLs like `/{packageId}.zvoice`.
- The bridge HTTP server must route root `.zvoice` requests to `voice_store.voice_dir()`.
- The runtime `voices.json` written at bridge startup must mark installed packages as `"remote": false` in the generated JSON model so the engine loads local packages.
- The engine init entry point is called via dynamically resolving the engine object (e.g. `window.Vh.init(extensionId)` in `20260625.1` or `window.Uh.init(...)` in earlier versions).
- The engine global symbol (`window.Vh`, `window.Uh`, etc.) is an obfuscated name from compiled browser extension code that changes across versions. `bridgeHarness.js` resolves this dynamically using `getTtsEngine()`. Do not assume any fixed global name will remain stable across future engine updates.
- `bridgeHarness.js` should remain strict-mode and IIFE-wrapped.
- Avoid changing PCM conversion semantics unless fixing a documented audio bug.

### SeaNet protected rate handling

- Apply protected high-rate behavior only to package IDs ending in `-seanet`, such as `multi-seanet`, `afh-seanet`, and `fis-seanet`.
- Do not apply the SeaNet artificial-rate path to non-SeaNet packages such as `multi`, `afh`, and `fis`.
- Keep the engine rate safer for SeaNet quality at high speeds, then apply artificial rate processing to generated PCM in `bridgeHarness.js`.
- Expect higher CPU usage when users read quickly with SeaNet packages because the add-on performs post-synthesis audio processing.

### CDP/WebSocket expectations

- Use the vendored websocket-client library from `websocketClientRepo/`; do not require users to install it with pip.
- Runtime binding messages are part of the audio transport contract. Preserve message shape unless both Python and JS sides are updated together.
- CDP calls should have clear timeouts or cancellation behavior where possible.
- Failures should surface as `CdpError` or logged exceptions with useful context.

---

## 7. Voice Package and Catalog Rules

### Runtime paths

| Purpose | Location |
|---|---|
| NVDA config root | `globalVars.appArgs.configPath` |
| Add-on data root | `{configPath}/googleTtsForNvda/` |
| Downloaded voices | `{configPath}/googleTtsForNvda/voices/` |
| Runtime voices.json | `{configPath}/googleTtsForNvda/runtime/voices.json` |
| Browser profiles | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/GoogleTtsForNvda/browserProfiles/session-*` |
| Master catalog | `WasmTtsEngine/20260625.1/voices.json` |

### `voice_store` contract

- `data_root() -> Path`
- `voice_dir() -> Path`
- `is_package_installed(package) -> bool`; verifies existence, size, and SHA-256
- `installed_packages(catalog) -> list[VoicePackage]`
- `download_package(package, progress?) -> Path`; only called from Voice Manager flows
- `remove_package(package)`
- `copy_existing_package(source, package) -> Path`

The SHA-256 verification cache must be invalidated after download, remove, and copy operations.

### `catalog` contract

- `VoiceCatalog.load(path?) -> VoiceCatalog`
- `VoiceCatalog(packages)` builds a filtered catalog
- `VoiceCatalog.package_for_voice(voiceId) -> VoicePackage`
- `VoiceCatalog.speaker_for_voice(voiceId) -> Speaker`
- `VoiceCatalog.to_runtime_json() -> str`

When changing catalog structure, update all code that depends on runtime JSON consumed by the WASM engine.

---

## 8. Voice Manager Accessibility Rules

When modifying `voiceManager.py` or any UI:

- Keep the dialog title clear: `Google TTS Voice Manager`.
- All lists must have an accessible name via `.SetName()`.
- Buttons must use accelerator keys, for example `&Remove selected`.
- Announce successful install/remove actions with `ui.message(...)`.
- Announce download progress at roughly 25% intervals.
- `Escape` closes the manager only when no operation is active.
- Veto closing while an operation is busy.
- On open, call `wx.CallAfter(self.focus_default_control)`.
- After operations, move focus to the most relevant list/control.
- Errors must be visible to screen-reader users, not only logged.
- Per-tab **Filter by language** comboboxes must retain independent selection state per tab and announce item counts clearly when filtered.
- Ensure the **Open voice packages folder** button correctly launches the system file explorer pointing to the installed voice directory.

---

## 9. Coding Conventions

### Python

- Use `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` and `from __future__ import annotations` in Python files.
- Use type hints, including Python 3.10+ union syntax (`str | None`).
- Modules use `snake_case`.
- NVDA-compatible properties/methods may use `camelCase` where NVDA expects it.
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` for filesystem paths unless existing code in the local area uses strings.
- Use context managers for files, sockets, temporary resources, and locks where practical.
- Avoid broad `except Exception` unless logging and fallback behavior are intentional.

### JavaScript

- Use `"use strict"`.
- Keep `bridgeHarness.js` IIFE-wrapped.
- Avoid global names except the explicit bridge API expected by Python.
- Keep message formats stable between JS and Python.
- Validate syntax with `node --check` when editing JS.

### Documentation

- Update `doc/en/readme.html` when changing user-visible settings or behavior.
- Keep localized documentation in `doc/<language>/readme.html` when a supported translation exists.
- Known stale documentation: it still mentions removed `acceleration mode` and `transposition`; remove or correct those references when touching settings docs.

### Translation and localization

- Keep user-facing NVDA UI strings wrapped in `_('...')` after `addonHandler.initTranslation()` is initialized.
- The translation template is `googleTtsForNvda/locale/nvda.pot`.
- Locale catalogs live at `googleTtsForNvda/locale/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po`.
- Generated translation files are `googleTtsForNvda/locale/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.mo` and `googleTtsForNvda/locale/<language>/manifest.ini`.
- Localized documentation lives at `googleTtsForNvda/doc/<language>/readme.html`.
- Translation docs must explain what each translation part affects: UI strings for NVDA dialogs/messages/settings, `.mo` for runtime loading, localized `manifest.ini` for NVDA add-on metadata, localized `readme.html` for user help, `languageSort.json` for visible Voice Manager language ordering, and `nvda.pot` as the source template.
- Keep localized `readme.html` terminology aligned with the locale's `nvda.po` UI translations and, where a setting label comes from NVDA itself, with NVDA's own locale translation.
- Translators may use Poedit to create or edit `nvda.po` from `nvda.pot`; when Poedit saves and keeps `.po` and `.mo` synchronized, `build_i18n.py` is used to validate the translation.
- If another translation tool edits `.po` but does not generate or synchronize `.mo`, use `build_i18n.py` to build the generated translation files and localized manifest.
- Running `python build_i18n.py` with no arguments must open the numbered interactive menu by default.
- Use `python build_i18n.py --all-languages` when automation needs to build or check every add-on locale without opening the interactive menu.
- Numbered translation menus must put the broad/default choice first: all add-on locales before individual locales, default/all checks before individual check categories, and then any manual/custom entry.
- Optional visible language sorting rules live at `googleTtsForNvda/locale/<language>/languageSort.json`.
- `languageSort.json` affects only Voice Manager display order for translated language names; it must not change displayed names, package IDs, catalog data, download behavior, removal behavior, or runtime JSON.
- If a locale has no valid `languageSort.json`, Voice Manager must keep catalog order for that locale.
- Use `python build_i18n.py --extract-template` after adding or changing translatable UI strings.
- Use `python build_i18n.py --check --language <language>` to validate one locale, or `python build_i18n.py --check` to validate all add-on locales.
- Default translation checks include NVDA language code, manifest, documentation, UI strings, placeholders, language sorting, and obsolete source strings.
- The `obsolete` check must fail active `.po` `msgid` entries that no longer exist in current Python `_()` strings or `manifest.ini`; commented `#~ msgid` entries from translation tools are ignored.
- Custom checks can run individual categories such as `manifest`, `docs`, `ui`, `placeholders`, `sort`, or `obsolete`; `--checks all` runs every category.
- Use `python build_i18n.py --language <language>` to build generated files only when the workflow relies on the script to generate `.mo` and localized `manifest.ini`.
- `build.bat` must call `python build_i18n.py --all-languages` so release packaging builds every add-on locale non-interactively, then removes `__pycache__` created by syntax checks before packaging.
- The English add-on author names are `Nguyen Anh Duc, Dao Duc Trung and Pham Hung Vuong`.
- For Vietnamese localization, write the authors as `Nguyễn Anh Đức, Đào Đức Trung và Phạm Hùng Vương`.
- When an author metadata line includes email addresses for Nguyen Anh Duc/Nguyễn Anh Đức and Dao Duc Trung/Đào Đức Trung, it must also include Pham Hung Vuong/Phạm Hùng Vương with `hungvuong106206@gmail.com`.
- For Vietnamese UI text that names standard dialog buttons, translate button labels consistently: `OK` as `Đồng ý`, `Cancel` as `Hủy bỏ`, `Yes` as `Có`, and `No` as `Không`.

## 10. Build, Packaging, and Verification

### Clean before packaging

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path googleTtsForNvda -Recurse -Directory -Filter __pycache__ |
    ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Recurse -Force }
Remove-Item -LiteralPath googleTtsForNvda\googleTtsForNvda.nvda-addon -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Build `.nvda-addon`

The `.nvda-addon` file is a ZIP archive:

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path googleTtsForNvda\* -DestinationPath dist\googleTtsForNvda-X.Y.Z.nvda-addon -Force
```

### Required checks by change type

For Python changes:

```powershell
python -m compileall googleTtsForNvda
```

For JavaScript changes:

```powershell
node --check googleTtsForNvda\synthDrivers\googleTtsForNvda\web\bridgeHarness.js
```

For voice/package changes:

```powershell
rg --files googleTtsForNvda -g "*.zvoice"
```

Expected result: no files.

For package inspection:

```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
$zip = [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead((Resolve-Path dist\googleTtsForNvda-*.nvda-addon))
$zip.Entries | Select-Object -First 30 -ExpandProperty FullName
$zip.Dispose()
```

### Version management

- Version is in `googleTtsForNvda/manifest.ini`, field `version`.
- Current version: `0.3`.
- Current authors: Nguyen Anh Duc, Dao Duc Trung and Pham Hung Vuong.
- NVDA compatibility: `minimumNVDAVersion = 2024.1.0`, `lastTestedNVDAVersion = 2026.1.0`. Code and packaging should preserve support for NVDA 2024 through 2026 on both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) builds.
- Increment `manifest.ini` before producing a release build.
- Do not increment version for internal experiments unless the user asks for a build/release.

## 11. Common Engineering Tasks

### Adding or fixing a synth setting

1. Confirm it belongs in the NVDA settings ring.
2. Add or update `_get_...` / `_set_...` methods in the synth driver.
3. Map NVDA 0-100 values to browser-runtime/WASM-compatible values in one place.
4. Preserve `RateBoostSetting()` behavior.
5. Do not re-add `Transposition` or `AccelerationMode` accidentally.
6. Update documentation and tests/checks.

### Fixing missing voice behavior

1. Check whether the package should be installed locally.
2. Use `voice_store.is_package_installed()`.
3. Do not auto-download.
4. Surface a useful error or Voice Manager prompt depending on startup vs speech-time context.
5. Confirm unavailable voices are not listed in NVDA settings.

### Touching the bridge harness

1. Update JS and Python sides together if the CDP binding protocol changes.
2. Keep cross-origin isolation headers unchanged.
3. Preserve audio chunk ordering and cancellation semantics.
4. Run `node --check`.
5. If possible, run a smoke synthesis with one installed voice.

### Touching Voice Manager

1. Keep all UI accessible by keyboard and screen reader.
2. Keep long operations on workers.
3. Use `wx.CallAfter()` for GUI updates.
4. Announce progress and outcomes with `ui.message(...)`.
5. Verify busy-state close behavior.

### Preparing a release package

1. Update `manifest.ini` version if this is a release.
2. Remove `__pycache__` and accidental build artifacts.
3. Verify no `.zvoice` files in source.
4. Run Python and JS syntax checks.
5. Build the `.nvda-addon` into `dist\`.
6. Inspect ZIP contents.
7. Summarize version, checks, and any untested runtime behavior.

## 12. Common Pitfalls

- Do not import NVDA modules at module level in test-friendly modules unless guarded.
- Do not use pip for `websocket-client`; the project vendors it.
- Do not commit or package temporary browser profiles.
- Do not commit or package `.zvoice` files.
- Do not bypass SHA-256 verification for voice packages.
- Do not forget to invalidate `_verifiedPackageCache` after package changes.
- Do not rename `window.Uh` or assume it is a stable public API.
- Do not remove COOP/COEP/CORP headers.
- Do not expose uninstalled voices in the settings ring.
- Do not make Voice Manager inaccessible by removing names, accelerators, focus handling, or progress announcements.
- Do not mix unrelated refactors with user-requested fixes.

## 13. Final Response Format for Coding Agents

When completing a task, respond with:

1. **Changed**: concise summary of files/behavior changed.
2. **Verified**: exact commands/checks run and their result.
3. **Notes/Risks**: anything not tested, compatibility concerns, or required follow-up.

If you could not complete a requested change, say what blocked it and provide the best partial result. Do not pretend a runtime NVDA/browser-runtime test was performed unless it actually was.
